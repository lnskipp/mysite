My name is Sebastian Hidvégi. In 2013, I graduated as a Bachelor of Business Administration in Laurea University of Applied Sciences. I have since then took part in various software/communication related production tasks. I have practiced IT since childhood, and I’m always eager to learn new ways to broaden my expertise and help others in their daily needs.
